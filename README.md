This is a Final project for my applied statistics class where I found car data and made some models with R to predict the prices of cars with certain varibles.
Since I did this project in 2021 I have lost my orginal R file where I did all of the code.
What is uploaded was a pdf of the results and commentary I submitted for my final project.
